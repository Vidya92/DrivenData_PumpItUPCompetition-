# DrivenData_PumpItUPCompetition-
Participating in ML social impact competition. 
I am excited to take part in this competition where I'll get to explore water pump management using data from Taarifa. Access to clean water is important for surival. 
Dataclean_manipul file contains mostly cleaned data. I removed a column that had 50% missing values and then did a listwise deletion for those that had less than 7% missing. 
I also re-labeled the status_groups to focus on the 'funtional' groups. So now I have a binary labeled column to classify. It's about 45/55
