# DrivenData_PumpItUPCompetition-
This is from the competition website but it data used for learning and training. 
Dataclean_manipul file contains mostly cleaned data. I removed a column that had 50% missing values and then did a listwise deletion for those that had less than 7% missing. 
I also re-labeled the status_groups to focus on the 'funtional' groups. So now I have a binary labeled column to classify. It's about 45/55 so mostly balanced.
